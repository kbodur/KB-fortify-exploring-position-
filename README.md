## Steps

1. **Find a Form:** Use the resources listed below to find a form that suits the requirements of your project.
2. **Design Your Form:** Based on the form you found, design your own version. This can involve HTML, CSS, JavaScript, or any frameworks you are comfortable with.
3. **Host Your Form:** Once your form is ready, host it on GitHub Pages. GitHub Pages allows you to turn GitHub repositories into web pages easily.

## Publishing on GitHub Pages

After designing your form, follow these steps to publish it on GitHub Pages:

1. Push your form's code to a GitHub repository.
2. Navigate to your repository's settings.
3. Scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" section.
4. Choose the branch where your form is located and select the folder.
5. Click "Save" or "Publish", and GitHub will provide you with a link to your form hosted on GitHub Pages.

## Include Your GitHub Pages Link

Once your form is published on GitHub Pages, edit this README file to include the link to your hosted form. Example:

```
[Link to My Form](https://username.github.io/repository-name)
```

This will allow others to access and view your form directly.
